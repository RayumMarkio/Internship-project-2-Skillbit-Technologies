# *Project Report: Basic Python Calculator*

## *Project Title:*

*Python Calculator*

## *Author:*

Rayum Markio

## *Technology Used:*

* *Programming Language:* Python
* *Version:* Python 3.13.6

---

## *1. Introduction*

The Python Calculator is a simple command-line application developed using Python 3.13.6. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator operates through user input and provides real-time results for the entered values.

---

## *2. Objective*

The main objective of this project is to create a basic calculator that demonstrates the use of:

* Functions in Python
* Control structures such as if, elif, and else
* User input handling
* Loops (while loop)
* Basic arithmetic operations

---

## *3. Project Description*

The calculator is interactive and runs continuously until the user decides to exit. It provides the following features:

### *Operations Supported:*

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit the application (n for cancel)

The calculator prompts the user to select an operation by entering a number between 1 and 4, or n to cancel. After choosing a valid operation, the user inputs two numbers on which the selected operation is performed. The result is then displayed on the screen.

---

## *4. Approach*

The implementation follows these steps:

1. *User Interface:*

   * Display a menu with choices: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, or Cancel.

2. *User Input:*

   * Take user input for selecting the operation.
   * Validate the input to ensure it's one of the supported options (1/2/3/4/n).

3. *Perform Operation:*

   * If a valid operation is selected, prompt the user for two numbers.
   * Use functions (add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide()) to perform the respective operations.
   * Display the result.

4. *Exit Condition:*

   * If the user enters n, the loop breaks and the application ends with a logout message.

## *5. Code Implementation*

python
# Program to make a basic calculator
# Author @inforkgodara

# Function adds two numbers
def add(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number + second_number

# Function subtracts two numbers
def subtract(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number - second_number

# Function multiplies two numbers
def multiply(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number * second_number

# Function divides two numbers
def divide(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number / second_number

print('Select options.')
print('1. Add')
print('2. Subtract')
print('3. Multiply')
print('4. Divide')

while True:
    # Take input from the console
    choice = input('Enter choice(1/2/3/4 or n to cancel): ')
    
    # Check if choice is one of the valid options
    if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
        first_number = float(input('Enter first number: '))
        second_number = float(input('Enter second number: '))

        if choice == '1':
            print(first_number, '+', second_number, '=', add(first_number, second_number))

        elif choice == '2':
            print(first_number, '-', second_number, '=', subtract(first_number, second_number))

        elif choice == '3':
            print(first_number, '*', second_number, '=', multiply(first_number, second_number))

        elif choice == '4':
            print(first_number, '/', second_number, '=', divide(first_number, second_number))

    elif choice == 'n':
        print('You are successfully logged out!')
        break
    else:
        print('Please enter correct input among these 1/2/3/4/n')

## *6. Conclusion*

The Python Calculator project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a basic calculator using core Python features. It is a useful foundational project for beginners to understand function creation, user input handling, control flow, and loop usage.
